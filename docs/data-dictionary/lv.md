### workflow_request_id

**In everyday language:** Identifier connecting this domain request to the approval workflow instance; inspect the relationship rules for whether a database link to another record is present.

**Why it is kept:** Keeps this record connected to the correct approval request, so related details can be checked together.

**Example:** This record points to an existing entry in requests instead of copying all of that entry’s details.

Technical definition: Identifier connecting this domain request to the approval workflow instance; inspect the relationship rules for whether a database FK is present.

| Property | Definition |
|---|---|
| SQL type | `bigint` |
| Required | Yes |
| Default | No database default |
| Definition basis | dictionary supplement; docs/03, docs/04 and current catalog |
| Code declaration | `workflow_request_id: number;` |
| Code source | [backend/src/core/db/types.ts](../../backend/src/core/db/types.ts) |
| Scope | Defined; documentation does not certify end-to-end implementation |

Value domain: no finite value list extracted. Use the SQL/code type and the complete rules below. Foreign-key values come from the referenced catalog; free text and extensible JSON have no invented fixed list.

Database rules (including conditions shared with other fields):

- `rh_selections_workflow_request_id_fkey`: `FOREIGN KEY (workflow_request_id) REFERENCES wf.requests(id)`

### applied

**In everyday language:** Approved optional holiday written to attendance.

**Why it is kept:** Lets the relevant process distinguish “yes” from “no” for this specific rule or condition.

**Example:** Yes means the condition described here is true; No means it is false.

Technical definition: Approved optional holiday written to attendance

| Property | Definition |
|---|---|
| SQL type | `boolean` |
| Required | Yes |
| Default | false |
| Definition basis | reviewer-authored field meaning (19 Oct 2026) |
| Code declaration | `applied: Generated<boolean>;` |
| Code source | [backend/src/core/db/types.ts](../../backend/src/core/db/types.ts) |
| Scope | Defined; documentation does not certify end-to-end implementation |

Allowed entries (source distinguishes database enforcement from code declarations):

| Entry | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `true` | The condition described by this field is enabled/true. | SQL boolean |
| `false` | The condition described by this field is disabled/false. | SQL boolean |

Database rules: no column-linked constraint in the captured catalog beyond the type/nullability/default above.

### created_at

**In everyday language:** Date and time this record was created.

**Why it is kept:** Establishes the recorded timing or time boundary for this detail, so staff can interpret the record in the right order.

**Example:** A saved time might show 11 Nov 2026, 10:30 AM IST. For an expiry or deadline, this is a boundary, not evidence that an event happened. NULL means no time is recorded.

Technical definition: Instant this record was created.

| Property | Definition |
|---|---|
| SQL type | `timestamp with time zone` |
| Required | Yes |
| Default | now() |
| Definition basis | catalog relationship / shared record convention |
| Code declaration | `created_at: DefaultedTimestamp;` |
| Code source | [backend/src/core/db/types.ts](../../backend/src/core/db/types.ts) |
| Scope | Defined; documentation does not certify end-to-end implementation |

Value domain: no finite value list extracted. Use the SQL/code type and the complete rules below. Foreign-key values come from the referenced catalog; free text and extensible JSON have no invented fixed list.

Database rules: no column-linked constraint in the captured catalog beyond the type/nullability/default above.

### updated_at

**In everyday language:** Date and time this record was last updated; not a complete change history.

**Why it is kept:** Establishes the recorded timing or time boundary for this detail, so staff can interpret the record in the right order.

**Example:** A saved time might show 11 Nov 2026, 10:30 AM IST. For an expiry or deadline, this is a boundary, not evidence that an event happened. NULL means no time is recorded.

Technical definition: Instant this record was last updated; not a complete change history.

| Code declaration | `updated_at: DefaultedTimestamp;` |
